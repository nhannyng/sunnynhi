I mainly focus on designing clear, understandable interfaces and creating a goal oriented user experience through iteration and prototyping. I know&#8230; it sounds very marketingy.

<p>Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind.</p>
