Portfolios may be held by individual investors and\/or managed by financial professionals, hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions. It is a generally accepted principle that a portfolio is designed according to the investor&#8217;s risk tolerance, time frame and investment objectives. The monetary value of each asset may influence the risk\/reward ratio of the portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>When determining a proper asset allocation one aims at maximizing the expected return and minimizing the risk. This is an example of a multi-objective optimization problem: many efficient solutions are available and the preferred solution must be selected by considering a tradeoff between risk and return.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, a portfolio A is dominated by another portfolio A&#8217; if A&#8217; has a greater expected gain and a lesser risk than A. If no portfolio dominates A, A is a Pareto-optimal portfolio.
